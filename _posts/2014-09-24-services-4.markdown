- Chesster - Talked about above, VR game in Unity/C# where the player takes on the abilities of differenct chess pieces to traverse a level. <br>
- Mr Blobby goes for a Bounce - Following the theme of 'Physics' with the rules of using only UE4/Blueprints/C++, developed a game in a team of 7, our game followed 2 blobs connected via an elastic escaping from their science beaker (single-player but could switch between blobs for tactical reasons, 3D jumping puzzle). <br>
- True Crime Spelling Romance - Following the theme of our name (randomly generated) and the rules of only using Unity/C#, developed a game in a team of 4, our game was a 2D typing challenge game. The player takes on a dyslexic man who is writing to his true love to confess his crimes, however what the player wants to type, gets all jumbled, thus they must attempt to get their point across without mistakes based on their confidence in their typing accuracy ability.
