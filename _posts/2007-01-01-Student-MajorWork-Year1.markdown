Title: Student Major Work Year 1: Flight of the Drones
<br>Platforms: PC
<br>Engine/Language: Unity Engine / C#
<br>Game Description: Local Multiplayer Drone game where players must keep the ball above the ground. 
<br>Team: 4 people including myself (2 programmers, 1 designer and 1 artist).
<br>Timeline: 6 weeks time, October-November 2016.
<br>Contribution: Mainly worked on UI functionality (keyboard/mouse and controller input for settings, main & pause menu) and a networked build of the game (decided to downsize workload to local multiplayer).
