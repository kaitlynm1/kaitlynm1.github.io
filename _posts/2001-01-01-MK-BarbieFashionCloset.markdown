**Game Description:** mobile dress up game based around Mattel's Barbie dolls, with outfit challenges, red carpet challenges and scrapbook features for more gameified elements. <br> 

**Role:** Co-lead programming beginning to end for 2 years of project life. <br>
Took on a legacy codebase from previous developer with no contact to them, optimised and restructured codebase where possible whilst actively developing new content. <br>
**Contribution:** 
- Integral role in creating systems for new features from inception to release (Red Carpet Challenges, Outfit Challenges, Scrapbook, new FTUE). <br>
- Optimised our workflows by creating tools to automate and simplify implementing new content in the game, such as clothing for dolls. Supported and collaborated with non-programmers on the team with how to use and build onto these tools effectively. This enabled art to be independently implementing new clothes faster and find bugs with blendshapes earlier **before** they got to QA testing. <br>
- Created Milestone management system (allowing us to work several releases ahead and safely test these changes early). <br>
- Created library of our commonly used tween animations into plug-and-play components for UI implementation, allowing the team to add more polish without coder/animation support. <br>
- Upkept and created large amounts of documentation for this project to help with onboarding of new team members smoother/quicker. <br>
